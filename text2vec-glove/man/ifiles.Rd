\title{Creates iterator over text files from the disk}
\usage{
ifiles(file_paths, reader = readLines)

idir(path, reader = readLines)

ifiles_parallel(file_paths, reader = readLines,
  n_chunks = foreach::getDoParWorkers())
}
\arguments{
\item{file_paths}{\code{character} paths of input files}

\item{reader}{\code{function} which will perform reading of text
files from disk, which should take a path as its first argument. \code{reader()} function should
return \bold{named character vector: elements of vector = documents,
names of the elements = document ids which will be used in DTM construction}.
If user doesn't provied names character vector, document ids will be generated as
file_name + line_number (assuming that each line is a document).}

\item{path}{\code{character} path of directory. All files in the directory will be read.}

\item{n_chunks}{\code{integer}, defines in how many chunks files will be processed.
For example if you have 32 files, and \code{n_chunks = 8}, then for each 4 files will be
created a job (for example document-term matrix construction).
In case some parallel backend registered, each job will be evaluated in a separated thread (process) in parallel.
So each such group of files will be processed in parallel and at the end all 8 results from will be combined.}

\description{
The result of this function usually used in an \link{itoken} function.
